    <h3>CS451 Final Project</h3>
    <p>No current eBook design provides for user-friendly interaction with photos. My eBook design, however, allows users to seamlessly explore photos and related photos while also preserving the integrity of the eBook experience. More specifically, the eBook itself contains text and images, of course, but some of the images are expandable into "recursive galleries" of various subject areas such as the Tuileries Garden. 
      <br>
      <br>
      A recursive gallery itself contains a horizontally scrollable gallery of more photos of the subject in question (such as the Tuileries). Although the horizontal scroll is not fully implemented here in the design, this functionality allows the user to discover more about the particular topic or subject area. A recursive gallery also contains a vertically scrollable gallery of related photos. In the full design, the vertical scroll would go on infinitely, and more related photos would populate the page as the user continues to scroll. Of these related photos, some are expandable into yet another recursive gallery. My design is built on this structural recursion of galleries, which allow the user to dive deep into the exploration of new photos.

      Because this design is a proof of concept, it only shows two levels of recursion. In the actual design, though, the user can go infinitely deep into the recursive galleries. As the user traverses deeper and deeper, he or she can easily hop back to book with one click of a button. However, the user is never lost, no matter how deep the recursion is. The user knows which gallery he or she is currently viewing and can always navigate between all galleries traversed thus far, providing a sort of "Table of Contents" feel for the galleries. This design gives users the power to discover more about the world through pictures.</p>
